Description: # vaeda
        
        vaeda (variaitonal auto-encoder (vae) for doublet annotation (da)) is a python package for doublet annotation in single cell RNA-sequencing. For method details and comparisons to alternative doublet annotation tools, see our [pre-print](https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.04.15.488440v1).
        
        #### Installation
        
        You can install ```vaeda``` using conda and pip as follows:
        
        ```
        conda create -n vaeda_env python=3.8
        conda activate vaeda_env
        
        pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow==2.8.0
        pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow-probability==0.16.0
        pip3 install 'scanpy[leiden]'==1.8.0
        pip3 install typing-extensions==3.7.4 absl-py==0.10 six==1.15.0 wrapt==1.12.1 xlrd==1.2.0
        pip3 install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ vaeda==0.0.17
        ```
        
        #### Quick Start
        
        In the following, X is a numpy array holding raw counts with cells as rows and genes as columns.
        
        ```
        import vaeda
        
        preds, preds_on_P, calls, encoding, knn_feature = vaeda.vaeda(X)
        
        ```
        
        Where:
        * preds are the doublet scores on the input data X
        * preds_on_P are doublet scores on the simulated doublets
        * calls are the doublet calls (ie, doublet or singlet) on the input data X
        * encoding is the low dimensional latent representation of the input data learned by vaeda's variational auto-encoder
        * knn_feature are the preliminary knn scores on the input data X
        
        #### More detailed example
        
        For a more detailed and accessible example, see ```./doc/vaeda_scanpy-pbmc3k-tutorial.ipynb```, where we modified a tutorial from ```scanpy``` [(https://scanpy-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pbmc3k.html)](https://scanpy-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pbmc3k.html) to illustrate how to use ```vaeda``` for doublet annotation.
